# meditation timer
A random timer paramaterized by a gaussian distribution that doesn't show you how long the timer is.  Plays a gong sound upon completion of the randomly generated time.  The intent is to get your mind focused on being present and not on how much time is left.

## Installation
1. Clone repo.
2. ???
3. Profit.

Seriously...

Run the string 'pip install -r requirements' to install playsound.  All others are base python.

## Usage

To call the script:
```{bash}
python timer.py
```

Can also be ran with positional args:

```{bash}      # lo  hi  mu sigma
python timer.py 100 500 200 50
```
